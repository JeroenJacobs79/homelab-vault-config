# Vault homelab setup

## Introduction

This repository contains the scripts I use to manage my lab-setup of [Hashicorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io). At the moment I'm using for PKI infrastructure (for my internal servers, and OpenVPN), and I'm playing with AppRoles and Kubernetes authentication. I decided to put this on GitHub in the hope someone finds this useful for their own experiments with Vault.

**(this repository is still a work in progress)**

## Pre-requisites

The scripts in this repository assume you already have an initialized and unsealed Vault instance.
